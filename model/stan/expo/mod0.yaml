description: Base model with non-centered parameterization.
notes:
- Sigmoidal Emax function of dose.  No covariates. No IIV.
- Additive residual error.
- Model does not capture within subject relationship between baseline and post-baseline
  observations.
- Initial assessment of convergence based on R-hat looks good.
